# 5:Matrix Multiplication Program

This program demonstrates matrix multiplication using NumPy.

## Description

This program performs matrix multiplication on two matrices, `matrix1` and `matrix2`, using the `numpy.matmul()` function. The resulting matrix is stored in the variable `multiplication`.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies: Make sure you have NumPy installed. You can install it using pip:


# 6:Binary Search Tree

This program demonstrates the implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in Python.

## Program Description

The program defines a `Node` class representing a node in the BST. Each node has a `data` value and references to its left and right children. The class provides methods to insert nodes into the tree and print the tree in order.

The `insert` method allows inserting nodes into the BST by comparing the data value with the current node's data. If the value is less, the method recursively traverses to the left child and inserts the node there. If the value is greater, the method traverses to the right child.

The `PrintTree` method uses inorder traversal to print the nodes of the tree in ascending order.

## Usage

- Create a `Node` object to represent the root of the tree.
- Use the `insert` method to add nodes to the tree, passing the data value to be inserted.
- Call the `PrintTree` method to print the elements of the tree in order.

## Example

```python
root = Node(12)
root.insert(6)
root.insert(14)
root.insert(3)
root.PrintTree()

#output

3
6
12
14
